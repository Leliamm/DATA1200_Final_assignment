        <h2>What is web accesibility?</h2>
        <p>Web accessibility is the wide known phenomenon that a website should be accessible to as many individuals as
          possible (Persson et. al. 2015). A website with good web accessibility is easy to access and use for all
          people. This includes people with and without disabilities. For instance, normal people using other devices
          with different screen sizes, or people with visual impairments.</p>
        <p>For this assignment we attempted to remove barriers which made our website inaccessible.</p>

        <h2>How did we test web accessibility?</h2>
        <p>To test web accessibility, we used an automated test, <a href="https://achecker.us/checker/index.php" target="blank">AChecker</a>, on all our pages. The website evaluated our
          HTML-code and gave us feedback on how we could improve our accessibility. We aimed for the grade AA or higher,
          since this indicated that there were no known problems with our code. </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="Img/accessibilityReviewMain.png" alt="This is a screenshot from the website Achecker that show that this website is AA graded and that there are no knwon accessibility problems.">
            <figcaption>Accessibility review made automatically by the website <a href="https://achecker.us/checker/index.php" target="blank">AChecker</a> </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Even so, we still made active decisions
            to improve our accessibility beyond what the test showed. The test also gave us a list of potential problems,
            which we carefully found and assessed. We fixed the ones we thought were applicable to our case.</p>
      </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Things we have changed</h3>
          <h4>Navigation bar</h4>
          <div class ="navBarGrid">
          <figure>
            <img id="navBarAccessibilityCheck" src="Img/navbarChangeNecessary.png" alt="This is a screenshot from the website Achecker that show a potential problem in our HTML code with the navigation bar.">
            <figcaption>Issue dettected by <a href="https://achecker.us/checker/index.php" target="blank">AChecker</a> </figcaption>
          </figure>          
          <figure>
            <img id = "navBarBefore" src="Img/navBarBefore.png" alt="This is a screenshot of our HTML document showing the code for the navigation bar before we changed it. The code is white text on a black backgrounnd">
            <figcaption>Code before the accessibility check</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>According to the automated check, the navigation bar is a list of links and must be marked appropriately.
          Therefore, we encapsuled our navigation bar with the semantic tag &lt;ul&gt; and the corresponding
          &lt;li&gt; for each item on the list.
          This ensures an isolated section with information, with <strong>excellent</strong> structure.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="Img/navBarAfter.png" alt="This is a screenshot of our HTML document showing the code for the navigation bar after we changed it to comply with accessibility. The code is white text on a black backgrounnd">
            <figcaption>Code after the accessibility check</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h4>"Skip to main content" button (with link)</h4>
          <p>According to the automated check we needed a “skip to main content” button. This will elevate our pages
            because our users can easily skip to the main content. Without this button, the process of navigating the
            website could be a tedious process for various people, especially for our friends with visual impairments.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Change not needed</h3>
          <h4>Format for h1, h2 and h3</h4>
          <p>According to the automated check, h1, h2 are potentially used for formatting. This is not the case. We used
            our header elements as section headers to structure our different themes. We only used formatting in a CSS
            file that is separated from the HTML files that we used in the accessibility check.</p>
          <h4>Primary language</h4>
          <p>According to the automated check, our webpages should only have one primary language. However, we used
            dummy text because it was allowed in our task description. Therefore, we choose to ignore the feedback. </p>

          <h3>Contradictory feedback</h3>
          <div class="contradictoryFeedback" >
          <figure>
            <img id = "altTextTooLong" src="Img/altTextTooLong.png" alt = "This is a screenshot from the website Achecker that informs is that the description text of the picture is too long.">
            <figcaption></figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <img id = "altTextTooShort" src="Img/altTextTooShort.png" alt = "This is a screenshot from the website Achecker that informs is that the description text of the picture is too short.">
            <figcaption></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
          <h4>Alt text for images</h4>
          <p>According to the automated check, we had two potential problems with our “alt” attribute to all our images.
            First, it assumed our alt descriptions should have been longer. Then it commented that our texts were too
            long. We choose to disregard both statements. Which lead to a detailed visual description for the users who
            cannot see them. Our alt text make it a better experience using a screen reader.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Web accessibility beyond the accesibility test</h2>
        <p>We used other accessibility tests to improve our visually impaired users experience. For instance, we used
          strong color contrasts for our texts, images, and background images. We tested our website used an online <a
            href="https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/" target="blank">colorblind test</a> to make sure
          colorblind people had no trouble seeing the different colors in our website. We also made sure to use the
          right sematic tags, and lines under all our links, so it would be easier to see the links properly. Lastly, we
          used fonts which makes it easy to read. As a result, people with visual impairments can still enjoy our page,
          without compromise. </p>
        <p>Some other coding changes we made include correct sematic tags and attributes accordingly. We used the
          &lt;html&gt;“lang” attribute to define our primary language. Furthermore, for all our images, we used the
          “alt” attribute. Lastly, we used “back to main content” buttons for our website for easy “scrolling” and tried
          to make our website easy to navigate.</p>
