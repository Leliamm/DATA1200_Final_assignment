      <h1> Welcome to our OsloMet experiences! </h1>
      <h2> This is a page created by one of the DATA1200 groups for the final assignment for the introduction 
        to HTML and CSS course. </h2>
      <h2> Short group bio</h2>
      <p>Our group formed this autumn and it contains five members. We all met as part of our TKD studies and even though we
        all come from different backgrouds, none of us had prior CSS and HTML experience, so we bonded as the unexperienced 
        and unpriviledged 
         We worked together for the two mandatory assignments 
        that we have been given, as well as for this one last step in completting DATA1200. </p>
      <p>Since we need to comply with grading anonimity rules provided by the norwegian law regarding evaluation in higher 
      education, we will not provide our names or any pictures of ourselves, so we chose computer generated images of 
      inexistent humans. </p>
