            <h1> Topical Info </h1>
            <p>Fake news is everywhere in the media. It can be found both in sosial media,
                and most media that provide news. Fake news has the purpose to either make entertaining
                articles that sell, share different political viewpoints or propaganda. Fake news is
                essentially manipulated news, whose purpose is to convince the audience that their opinion
                is factual. Where the news is not entirely true, but has been taken out of context in order
                to create something scandalous. This type of news is especially common in countries
                characterized by a dictatorship rule. This may be to get the population on their side.
                Fake news can also be used to damage a person's reputation, by providing false information.
                On another hand we think fake news is really not something serious, because it has been
                used in a way where politicians try to persuade people that they would never do any wrong.
                I think there is a lot of fake news where people share some outrageous stories disguised
                as real news to shock or persuade someone to do or think something about something. </p>
            <p>
                Fake news is also where journalists twist words of certain people, in order to make a
                clickbait article/title so that the company will get financial benefit from that article.
                There is no definitive answer to what fake news is, but a common definition can be misleading
                and untrue information that is shared, usually to manipulate. The best way of dealing with
                fake news is to fact check every site with other sites. You should always og to a trusted site
                not like wikipedia and dagbladet where everyone essentially could write anything. You should
                also always think critically about everything. Lastly, its also really important that you check
                the date. You can never know when the media is pulling a april fools joke. </p>
